                <h3>My name is Sabina Halidovic.</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a first year student majoring in Software Engineering at FSCE FINKI. <br>
                    I chose to major in software engineering because of my passion for technology<br>
                    and the limitless possibilities it offers.<br>
                    My ID is 221571.<br>
                    From a young age, I found myself fascinated by computers,<br>their functionality,
                    and their ability to solve complex problems.<br>
                    As I delved deeper into the world of technology, I realized that<br>
                    software engineering is at the heart of innovation and drives progress in various industries.

                    21 years old, my birthday is on May 13 2003, born in Struga, North Macedonia.
                    <br>
                    During the school year, I relocate to Skopje to pursue my studies. 
                    <br>
                    Balancing my time between these two cities allows me to appreciate<br>
                    the diverse cultural and social landscapes of North Macedonia.
