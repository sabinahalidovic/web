    As long as the academic knowledge and my passion of photography go,<br>
    I have established hobbies and skills from a young age.
    One of my favorite was art.
    Art is one of the best forms u can express yourself without saying anything,
    just as I said every image has a story, every painting has its story as well.<br>
    One of my favorite places to explore my vision of art is in nature.<br>
    I can proudly say this is one of my favorite skill I have.

        My second hobby is sport, cliché but it is one of my healthiest habits too.
        Health is the most important thing in life.
        I did sport as a hobby since I was very young, I played volleyball, basketball, running.
        Running was my favorite out of every sport.<br>
        It is one of my nest skills. Running small or big marathons it fills every void.
        I won 4 competitions.
        I started training when I was 8 years old, and as the years went by I got faster and faster at running.

<p class="descriprion">
    Baking allows me to express my creativity. From decorating cakes with intricate designs<br>
    to experimenting with new flavors and ingredients, each baking session is a <br>
    chance to bring my imaginative ideas to life. The endless possibilities for customization<br>
    mean that no two baked goods are ever the same.Baking is a way to spread happiness.<br>
    Sharing homemade treats with family, friends, and neighbors creates a sense of connection.
    It’s heartwarming to know that something I made can brighten someone’s day.

      <hr>
        <p class="descriprion">
        The repetitive nature of crocheting is deeply relaxing.<br>
        The rhythmic motion of the hook and yarn helps me enter a meditative state,
        reducing stress and promoting mindfulness. It’s a perfect way to unwind after a busy day and clear my mind.<br>
        Crocheting connects me to a tradition of handcrafting. Many techniques and patterns have been
        passed down through generations,and practicing this craft allows me to honor and continue these traditions.<br>
